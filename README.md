# Smart Task Planner

**Smart Task Planner** is an AI-driven scheduling application designed to help students and professionals organize their workload effortlessly. It doesn't just list tasks; it automatically generates a structured weekly timetable based on your specific deadlines and priorities using DSA-based scheduling algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Supabase Authentication**: Secure login and registration with user profile syncing.
- **Dynamic Weekly Planner**: Automatically generates a timetable organized by categories (Exams, Projects, College, etc.) using a Greedy Scheduling Algorithm.
- **Unified Architecture**: Restructured into a single Next.js project deployable entirely on Vercel.
- **Direct Supabase Integration**: Uses Supabase Client SDK for real-time data management without a separate backend.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: 
    - **Not Applicable (NA)**: For tasks without specific times.
    - **Estimated Duration**: Automatically calculates end-times based on your start-time.
    - **Fixed Time**: Set precise start and end times for rigid schedules.
- **Priority-Based Visuals**: Tasks are color-coded (Red for High, Yellow for Medium, Green for Low).
- **Global Dashboard**: Provides a "Planner's Summary" and lists the next 5 most urgent tasks.
- **Responsive UI**: A premium, clean, and modern interface built with Vanilla CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React)
- **Database & Auth**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL)
- **Serverless Logic**: Next.js API Routes
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd smart-task-planner
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder:
```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
# Required for user syncing logic in API routes
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key 
```

### 3. Install & Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Deployment
This project is optimized for **Vercel**. 
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Connect your repository to Vercel.
3. Add your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Deploy! No separate backend deployment on Render is required.

## Database Schema
The application uses the following tables in Supabase:
- `users`: Stores user profiles (linked to Supabase Auth).
- `tasks`: Stores all user tasks with deadlines, priorities, and time configurations.
- `generated_plans`: Stores the optimized JSON timetable generated by the algorithm.
